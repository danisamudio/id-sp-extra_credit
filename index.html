 <p>As I’m finishing up my junior year as a graphic design mayor, I had to take a website design class called “Interactive Design.” To be honest, when I registered for the class, I had no idea what it was about, I just knew that I had to take it in order to graduate.</p>
<p> Over winter break I decided to find out what the class was about, and when I saw that it was about web design, I got so nervous! The thing is that in high school, I kind of learned to code in computer class. It was an interesting experience but when you put a group of uninterested teenagers with a computer geek teacher, it is chaos. I actually enjoyed to learn the basics and when doing group projects I was the only one who worked so I ended up hating to code.</p>
<p>I decided to give it another chance now that I was in college and the students who take the class are actually interested in the topic. First day of class arrived, and I felt so cool writing html! I really felt like i was hacking a website or something.</p>
<p>By the end of the semester I made 3 websites, but I’m not gonna lie that I struggled a lot! I’m so nervous about my final grade that I’m doing this extra credit website which Justin, the cool professor, let us do to improve our grade lol Okay, I’m not failing but I would like a good grade :P </p>
 <p>So, here are so tips for a student new to web design. Don’t make the same mistakes as I! </p>
   </div>
    
      
    <ul id= "tips">
      <h3> <li>Don’t be scared to ask questions.</li> </h3>
<p>At the beginning of the semester everyone was at the same level of knowledge but as we continued to learn new things I felt left behind and had so many questions that I thought were dumb that I did not asked anything. One day I decided that I had to talk the professor about my confusion so I `slack´ him and he helped me a lot. He did not judged me for my basic questions. </p>
      
      <h3> <li> Don’t be afraid of feedback </li> </h3>
<p>Going off with that, the professor gave me feedback and suggestions about how to improve my website design. Feedback and critiques are really helpful when doing any kind of design, especially when it comes from your peers because they usually are in the same page as you.</p>
      
      <h3><li>Take notes</li></h3>
<p>I never took notes! And that was when all of my coding confusion started. While in class, I paid attention and wrote codes while the professor explained it but when I was home doing the homework and read my coding, I would forget what was for what. what on earth is a “div”?! and why do I have it all over my html?</p>
      
      <h3><li>Distractions</li></h3>
<p>Try not to text or use social media doing class. Yeah it was a 4 hours long class and it can get boring but don’t forget that this class has a grade. Just because we are not in a classroom listening to a lecture or studying a theory it doesn't make it less important. As others professor demand to pay attention and not use your phone, this class deserves all the attention and even more, because if you get lost in 1 part, then all of the code can get ruined.</p>
      
      <h3><li> Sketch </li></h3>
<p>I had so many ideas on my mind about how to code and design a website, but when I tried to put it into code, it just didn’t worked. I never did a sketch of what I wanted my website to look like, not even for this one lol. If I had something visual to look at, it would have been easier to design it.</p>
      
      <h3> <li>Simple But Effective</li> </h3>
<p>By the middle of the semester I realized that I wasn’t as good at designing websites as my classmates, and it frustrated me. Because of this, I began to think big when we had to do a website. I wanted extravagant navigation, beautiful headers or cool tittles. But it just never worked, and my websites ended up being “simple”. I mentioned to my professor that I was disappointed about my skills because my design was too simple. He said that it doesn’t matter that it is simple, nothing is simple, I just coded a website and wrote in a different robotic language, I should give some credit to myself. Just because it is simple does not mean that it is bad. What it matters is that it works and informs the viewer. </p>
    </ul>
      </div>
    
       <div class="intro_outro">   
<p>I encourage design students to learn how to web design, because nowadays everything has a website and everyone uses a browser! You can learn the basics as I just did and if you like it you can continue to learn this new language and get famous by design beautiful websites. Because, lets be honest, there are so many ugly website around the internet.</p>
